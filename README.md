# ffmpeg-build-armhf-pi4
Dockerized builder for ffmpeg to be used with Raspberry Pi 4 on armhf architecture in Debian 10 or Raspbian Buster. As is, the resulting deb package from 'docker build ...' provides a static ffmpeg binary under /usr/local/bin. If opengl support is needed, uncomment RUN step for installing libgles2-mesa-dev and switch the '--disable-opengl' to '--enable-opengl'; the target OS will also need libgles2-mesa-dev. Similarly, if ffplay is needed uncomment RUN step for installing libsdl2-dev and switch the '--disable-ffplay' to '--enable-ffplay', and uncomment the line 'cp -a "${PREFIX}"/bin/ffplay' in the final RUN step for building the deb package; libsdl2-dev will be needed on the target OS.
